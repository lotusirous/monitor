> This is a utility for monitoring in progressing the project.
Although there are already several existing monitoring tools, there is a multiple monitoring tools, but if the project is on, the scale is large (if you are scaled out or branching the server according to each function(service(?)))
You will need to install the agent to monitor for each branched server.
Multi-monitoring utility enables monitoring without having to install a separate agent on the monitoring server by adding only instance information of the server to the configuration file every time the server branches.
Monitoring means that when a specific keyword is specified and the keyword is printed in the log, You can send the information by e-mail to receive it.
